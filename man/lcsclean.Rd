\usage{
lcsclean(dataset, notes, propor, identifier, pageid)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{the dataset containing the notes}

\item{notes}{the column name for the notes}

\item{propor}{minimum necessary of matching proportion of previous notes for removal}

\item{identifier}{column name for uniquely identifying identification}

\item{pageid}{column name for page number}

Page=c(1,2,1,2,3,1,2))
