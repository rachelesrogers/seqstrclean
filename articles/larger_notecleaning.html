<p>This article focuses on note cleaning for a larger data set. While
time-consuming, this code demonstrates the full application of this
package, with a workable example of hybrid note cleaning.</p>

<p>The third method attempts to combine the speed of the First N
Character method with the accuracy of the Longest Common Substring
method. This works by first applying the First N Character method, then
applying the Longest Common Substring method for difficult cases -
either when the edit distance is too large for the First N Character
method to remove notes (such as the chicken chasing example above), or
when the length of the cleaned notes is unusually large. Unusually large
is defined as more than a set number of standard deviations above the
mean clean note length, and is calculated using the extremeid
function.</p>
<p>For this method, a larger dataset may be necessary to demonstrate the
presence of outliers, in terms of note size.</p>

<p>Above demonstrates the validation dataset cleaned using the First N
Character method, with a character difference cutoff of 16 (meaning that
up to and including a 15 character difference is acceptable). In order
to determine if there are any extremely long note pages that should be
considered for the Longest Common Substring method, the extremeid
function is applied. Here, extreme values are defined as those that are
larger than 4 standard deviations above the mean page length, based on
algorithm condition (because these resulted in different pages, and thus
different notes).</p>

<p>Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.Police received a 911
call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the
store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then
demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any
money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.</p>
<p>The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a
close enough look at the robber’s face to make an identification,
because the robber wore a ski mask.</p>
<p>As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed
a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled
by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.</p>
<p>Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience
store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet
from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic
analysis.</p>
<p>Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for
speeding. During a search of the Defendant’s vehicle, the detective
located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant.
Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience
store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was
subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm
in a place of business.</p>
<p>terry smith: Q: What training is required to become a firearms
examiner with the local police department? A: I received my bachelor’s
degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab
from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program,
which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I’ve toured
manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were
produced; and I’ve attended several national and regional meetings of
firearms examiners. A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet
matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the
characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for
the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more
likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on
the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and
Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the
algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion
was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all
21 cases. Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet
matching algorithm? A: They have been using it since January of
2020.</p>
<p>Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching
algorithm? A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.</p>
<p>Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions,
given the results of your testing? A: Yes, I have. A: No. When firing a
firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion.
When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator,
what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the
casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the
microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will
slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic
process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly
differently from one to the next.</p>
<p>Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be
qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject
to cross examination. Court: Any cross on their credentials? Defense:
No, Your Honor. Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms
identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go
ahead. A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions
called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes
down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and
accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the
manufacturer. They’re cut into the barrel. And each particular file has
a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those
lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down
the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into
the bullet. A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll
the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area:
unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point,
when I’ve seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at
all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique
detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the
bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. A: The
algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface
contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result
in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0
indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the
maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the
lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for
the entire bullet.</p>
<p>Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets? A:
The match score was 0.976.</p>
<p>Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire
bullet and the fired evidence? A: The match score was 0.989.</p>
<p>Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets? A: The
match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the
two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the
same barrel.</p>
<p>Q: Is it the local police department’s protocol to have somebody else
who’s a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report,
review your work, and determine if it’s correct? A: Yes.</p>
<p>Q: That’s what we call peer review? A: Peer review, yes.</p>
<p>Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found
to constitute sufficient agreement? A: No, there is not a fixed amount
or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm,
however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient
agreement. |Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to

down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and
accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the
manufacturer. They’re cut into the barrel. And each particular file has
a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those
lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down
the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into
the bullet. A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll
the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area:
unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point,
when I’ve seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at
all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique
detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the
bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. A: The
algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface
contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result
in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0
indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the
maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the
lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for
the entire bullet.</p>
<p>Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets? A:
The match score was 0.976.</p>
<p>Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire
bullet and the fired evidence? A: The match score was 0.989.</p>
<p>Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets? A: The
match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the
two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the
same barrel.</p>
<p>Q: Is it the local police department’s protocol to have somebody else
who’s a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report,
review your work, and determine if it’s correct? A: Yes.</p>
<p>Q: That’s what we call peer review? A: Peer review, yes.</p>
<p>Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found
to constitute sufficient agreement? A: No, there is not a fixed amount
or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm,
however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient
agreement. |TRUE |</p>
<p>The comments that should then be considered using the Longest Common
Substring method are those with an extremely large amount of notes
(extreme_value=TRUE), and those with an edit distance above the cutoff
used in the First N Character method (larger than 15). Note that the
previous page of notes is also necessary for comparison in the Longest
Common Substring method.</p>

<p>Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.Police received a 911
call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the
store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then
demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any
money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.</p>
<p>The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a
close enough look at the robber’s face to make an identification,
because the robber wore a ski mask.</p>
<p>As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed
a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled
by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.</p>
<p>Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience
store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet
from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic
analysis.</p>
<p>Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for
speeding. During a search of the Defendant’s vehicle, the detective
located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant.
Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience
store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was
subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm
in a place of business.</p>
<p>terry smith: Q: What training is required to become a firearms
examiner with the local police department? A: I received my bachelor’s
degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab
from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program,
which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I’ve toured
manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were
produced; and I’ve attended several national and regional meetings of
firearms examiners. A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet
matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the
characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for
the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more
likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on
the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and
Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the
algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion
was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all
21 cases. Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet
matching algorithm? A: They have been using it since January of
2020.</p>
<p>Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching
algorithm? A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.</p>
<p>Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions,
given the results of your testing? A: Yes, I have. A: No. When firing a
firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion.
When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator,
what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the
casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the
microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will
slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic
process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly
differently from one to the next.</p>
<p>Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be
qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject
to cross examination. Court: Any cross on their credentials? Defense:
No, Your Honor. Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms
identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go
ahead. A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions
called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes
down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and

given the results of your testing? A: Yes, I have. A: No. When firing a
firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion.
When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator,
what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the
casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the
microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will
slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic
process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly
differently from one to the next.</p>
<p>Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be
qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject
to cross examination. Court: Any cross on their credentials? Defense:
No, Your Honor. Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms
identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go
ahead. A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions
called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes
down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and
accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the
manufacturer. They’re cut into the barrel. And each particular file has
a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those
lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down
the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into
the bullet. A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll
the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area:
unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point,
when I’ve seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at
all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique
detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the
bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. A: The
algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface
contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result
in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0
indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the
maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the
lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for
the entire bullet.</p>
<p>Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets? A:
The match score was 0.976.</p>
<p>Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire
bullet and the fired evidence? A: The match score was 0.989.</p>
<p>Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets? A: The
match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the
two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the
same barrel.</p>
<p>Q: Is it the local police department’s protocol to have somebody else
who’s a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report,
review your work, and determine if it’s correct? A: Yes.</p>
<p>Q: That’s what we call peer review? A: Peer review, yes. |A: No. When
