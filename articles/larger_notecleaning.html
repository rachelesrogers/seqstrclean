<p>The third method attempts to combine the speed of the First N
Character method with the accuracy of the Longest Common Substring
method. This works by first applying the First N Character method, then
applying the Longest Common Substring method for difficult cases -
either when the edit distance is too large for the First N Character
method to remove notes (such as the chicken chasing example above), or
when the length of the cleaned notes is unusually large. Unusually large
is defined as more than a set number of standard deviations above the
mean clean note length, and is calculated using the extremeid
function.</p>
<p>For this method, a larger dataset may be necessary to demonstrate the
presence of outliers, in terms of note size.</p>

<p>Above demonstrates the validation dataset cleaned using the First N
Character method, with a character difference cutoff of 16 (meaning that
up to and including a 15 character difference is acceptable). In the
above example, the method is successfully applied (as can be seen
comparing the “notes” column to the cleaned “page_notes” column).</p>
<p>However, not all notes are as clear-cut as the example above. For the
example below, the true value of the cleaned notes should be as shown in
the “corrected_notes” column. The First N Character method fails in this
case - because the edit distance (94) is larger than the set threshold
(16), no notes would be removed.</p>

In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with
willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a
felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.Police received a
911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered
the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then
demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any
money and no one was hurt by the gunshot. The store clerk took the stand
and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber’s face
to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask. As the
cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden
button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the
alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store. Next, the detective
testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the
clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the
store, which was collected for forensic analysis. Two days later, a
police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of
the Defendant’s vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was
legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber
as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated
for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with
willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. terry smith: Q:
What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local
police department? A: I received my bachelor’s degree in forensic
science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene
unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by
experienced firearms examiners; I’ve toured manufacturing facilities and
saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I’ve attended several
national and regional meetings of firearms examiners. A: Yes. I received
training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm
that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to
produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar
bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended
a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for
Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me
to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my
conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the
algorithm in all 21 cases. Q: How long have the state police been using
the bullet matching algorithm? A: They have been using it since January
of 2020. Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet
matching algorithm? A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times. Q: As a
firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the
results of your testing? A: Yes, I have. A: No. When firing a firearm
there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the
firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets
it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and
the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic
imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward
against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it
happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the
next. Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith
be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification
subject to cross examination. Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor. Court: This witness is an expert in the area of
firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as
facts. Go ahead. A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised
portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet
passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability
and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the
manufacturer. They’re cut into the barrel. And each particular file has
a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those
lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down
the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into
the bullet. A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll
the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area:
unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point,
when I’ve seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at
all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique
detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the
bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. A: The
algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface
contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result
in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0
indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the
maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the
lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for
the entire bullet. Q: What was the match score between the two
test-fired bullets? A: The match score was 0.976. Q: What was the match
score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989. Q: What does this match score indicate
about the bullets? A: The match score indicates that there is
substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they
were most likely fired from the same barrel. Q: Is it the local police
department’s protocol to have somebody else who’s a firearms tool mark
examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine
if it’s correct? A: Yes. Q: That’s what we call peer review? A: Peer
review, yes. Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to
be found to constitute sufficient agreement? A: No, there is not a fixed
amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm,
however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient
agreement.

<p>In order to determine if there are any extremely long note pages that
should be considered for the Longest Common Substring method, the
extremeid function is applied. Here, extreme values are defined as those
that are larger than 4 standard deviations above the mean page length,
based on a condition in the dataframe (“algorithm”), which resulted in
different information being presented to note-takers, thus providing
different notes.</p>

In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with
willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a
felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.Police received a
911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered
the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then
demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any
money and no one was hurt by the gunshot. The store clerk took the stand
and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber’s face
to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask. As the
cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden
button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the
alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store. Next, the detective
testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the
clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the
store, which was collected for forensic analysis. Two days later, a
police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of
the Defendant’s vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was
legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber
as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated
for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with
willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. terry smith: Q:
What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local
police department? A: I received my bachelor’s degree in forensic
science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene
unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by
experienced firearms examiners; I’ve toured manufacturing facilities and
saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I’ve attended several
national and regional meetings of firearms examiners. A: Yes. I received
training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm
that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to
produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar
bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended
a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for
Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me
to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my
conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the
algorithm in all 21 cases. Q: How long have the state police been using
the bullet matching algorithm? A: They have been using it since January
of 2020. Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet
matching algorithm? A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times. Q: As a
firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the
results of your testing? A: Yes, I have. A: No. When firing a firearm
there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the
firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets
it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and
the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic
imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward
against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it
happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the
next. Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith
be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification
subject to cross examination. Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor. Court: This witness is an expert in the area of
firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as
facts. Go ahead. A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised
portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet
passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability
and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the
manufacturer. They’re cut into the barrel. And each particular file has
a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those
lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down
the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into
the bullet. A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll
the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area:
unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point,
when I’ve seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at
all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique
detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the
bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. A: The
algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface
contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result
in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0
indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the
maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the
lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for
the entire bullet. Q: What was the match score between the two
test-fired bullets? A: The match score was 0.976. Q: What was the match
score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989. Q: What does this match score indicate
about the bullets? A: The match score indicates that there is
substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they
were most likely fired from the same barrel. Q: Is it the local police
department’s protocol to have somebody else who’s a firearms tool mark
examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine
if it’s correct? A: Yes. Q: That’s what we call peer review? A: Peer
review, yes. Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to
be found to constitute sufficient agreement? A: No, there is not a fixed
amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm,
however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient
agreement.

willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. terry smith: Q:
What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local
police department? A: I received my bachelor’s degree in forensic
science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene
unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by
experienced firearms examiners; I’ve toured manufacturing facilities and
saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I’ve attended several
national and regional meetings of firearms examiners. A: Yes. I received
training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm
that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to
produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar
bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended
a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for
Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me
to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my
conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the
algorithm in all 21 cases. Q: How long have the state police been using
the bullet matching algorithm? A: They have been using it since January
of 2020. Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet
matching algorithm? A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times. Q: As a
firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the
results of your testing? A: Yes, I have. A: No. When firing a firearm
there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the
firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets
it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and
the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic
imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward
against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it
happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the
next. Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith
be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification
subject to cross examination. Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor. Court: This witness is an expert in the area of
firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as
facts. Go ahead. A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised
portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet
passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability
and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the
manufacturer. They’re cut into the barrel. And each particular file has
a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those
lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down
the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into
the bullet. A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll
the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area:
unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point,
when I’ve seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at
all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique
detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the
bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. A: The
algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface
contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result
in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0
indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the
maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the
lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for
the entire bullet. Q: What was the match score between the two
test-fired bullets? A: The match score was 0.976. Q: What was the match
score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989. Q: What does this match score indicate
about the bullets? A: The match score indicates that there is
substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they
were most likely fired from the same barrel. Q: Is it the local police
department’s protocol to have somebody else who’s a firearms tool mark
examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine
if it’s correct? A: Yes. Q: That’s what we call peer review? A: Peer
review, yes.

In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with
willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a
felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.Police received a
911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered
the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then
demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any
money and no one was hurt by the gunshot. The store clerk took the stand
and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber’s face
to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask. As the
cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden
button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the
alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store. Next, the detective
testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the
clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the
store, which was collected for forensic analysis. Two days later, a
police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of
the Defendant’s vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was
legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber
as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated
for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with
willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. terry smith: Q:

<p>The above notes show an easy and a difficult case for the First N
Character method (indicated as “page_notes”). In the first row, the FNC
method is able to correctly distinguish between old and new notes (with
a slight issue due to a deleted line break between sentences, resulting
in the lose of “Po” at the beginning of “Police”). In this case, LCS
does not need to be applied, and the FNC notes are copied into the
“hybrid_notes” column. In the second row, the FNC method fails, leading
to the application of LCS. These notes are then included in the
“hybrid_notes” column, so that this represents the full dataset of
cleaned notes.</p>
