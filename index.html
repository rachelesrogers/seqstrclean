<p>The goal of seqstrclean is to clean sequential strings. In cumulative note taking, notes from a previous section may be saved alongside notes from the current section. This package aims to remove the previous section’s notes, leaving only notes from the current section. For example, a person may take the note: “A cat ran up a tree.” initially, then add “The cat was chased by a dog”. The notepad would then show: “A cat ran up a tree. The cat was chased by a dog”. This package is meant to separate the notes into the two parts based on the different saves of the notepad.</p>
<p>The firstnchar function compares the beginning of the latest notes to the previous section, and removes from the latest notes if they are similar enough (determined by edit distance).</p>
<p>The lcsclean function compares the entirety of both note sheets and locates the longest common substring between the two, which is removed from the latest note sheet if it represents a significant portion of the previous notes.</p>

<p>There are three methods used for sequential note cleaning in this package: First N Character, Longest Common Substring, and a hybrid method combining the two. The First N Character method is faster, while in a small verification study the Longest Common Substring method was more accurate. The hybrid method strikes a balance between the speed of the First N Character method and the accuracy of the Longest Common Substring method by only applying the Longest Common Substring method to difficult cases (where previous text cannot be removed using the First N Character method, or the supplied note sheet is unusually long).</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="first-n-character-method">First N Character Method<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#first-n-character-method"></a>
</h3>
<p>The first method is the First N Character method, where the entirety of the previous page’s notes are compared with the first n characters of the current page’s notes (where n is the length of the previous page’s notes). If the notes are similar enough (based on edit distance), the first n characters will be removed from the current page.</p>

<p>In the test dataset shown above, there are third note-takes (identified by ID number), and 2-3 pages of notes. The first individual wrote “The”, “cat”, and “ran” sequentially on their notes, with one word per page. The second individual wrote “The” and “dog” sequentially. The third individual wrote “the chicken was chased” on the first page, and “The goat chased the chicken” on the second page, which does not reflect sequential note-taking. The First N Character method can be used to separate these notes, based on what was written per page.</p>

<p>Here, page_notes displays the clean notes, and edit_distance refers to the distance between the previous page of notes and the first n character of the current page of notes. In the cases of sequential notes (for individuals 1 and 2), the edit distance is 0, as the beginning of the notes match the previous page’s notes. In the case of the third individual, the edit distance is 4 (there are four substitutions necessary to change from “goat” to “chick”), which is greater than the set threshold of 3. Thus, the second page of the third individual’s notes include the full text recorded on the second page (nothing was removed).</p>

<p>The second method is the Longest Common Substring method, where the two page note strings are compared in their entirity for the longest string they have in common, above a certain threshold. This longest string is then removed from the current page of notes, and the process is repeated until the longest common substring is no longer above the assigned cutoff.</p>

<p>The third method attempts to combine the speed of the First N Character method with the accuracy of the Longest Common Substring method. This works by first applying the First N Character method, then applying the Longest Common Substring method for difficult cases - either when the edit distance is too large for the First N Character method to remove notes (such as the chicken chasing example above), or when the length of the cleaned notes is unusually large. Unusually large is defined as more than a set number of standard deviations above the mean clean note length, and is calculated using the extremeid function.</p>
<p>For this method, a larger dataset may be necessary to demonstrate the presence of outliers, in terms of note size.</p>

<p>Above demonstrates the validation dataset cleaned using the First N Character method, with a character difference cutoff of 16 (meaning that up to and including a 15 character difference is acceptable). In order to determine if there are any extremely long note pages that should be considered for the Longest Common Substring method, the extremeid function is applied. Here, extreme values are defined as those that are larger than 4 standard deviations above the mean page length, based on algorithm condition (because these resulted in different pages, and thus different notes).</p>

<p>In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.</p>
<p>Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.</p>
<p>The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber’s face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.</p>
<p>As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.</p>
<p>Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.</p>
<p>Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant’s vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.</p>
<p>terry smith: Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department? A: I received my bachelor’s degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I’ve toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I’ve attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners. A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases. Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm? A: They have been using it since January of 2020.</p>
<p>Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm? A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.</p>
<p>Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing? A: Yes, I have. A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.</p>
<p>Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination. Court: Any cross on their credentials? Defense: No, Your Honor. Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead. A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They’re cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet. A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I’ve seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.</p>
<p>Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets? A: The match score was 0.976.</p>
<p>Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence? A: The match score was 0.989.</p>
<p>Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets? A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel.</p>
<p>Q: Is it the local police department’s protocol to have somebody else who’s a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it’s correct? A: Yes.</p>
Q: That’s what we call peer review? A: Peer review, yes.

When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.</p>
<p>Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets? A: The match score was 0.976.</p>
<p>Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence? A: The match score was 0.989.</p>
<p>Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets? A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel.</p>
<p>Q: Is it the local police department’s protocol to have somebody else who’s a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it’s correct? A: Yes.</p>
<p>Q: That’s what we call peer review? A: Peer review, yes.</p>
<p>Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement? A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.</p>
<p>Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct? A: Yes, it does.</p>
<p>Q: You, personally, don’t know the source code; is that correct? A: That’s correct.</p>
<p>Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say? A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.</p>
<p>—Questions Submitted By the Jury—</p>
<p>The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you’re able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure? A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it’s about 1.5 to 1.9. That’s just a general number that’s out there.</p>
<p>DR ADRIAN JONES</p>
<p>Q: What is your current occupation? A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.</p>
<p>Q: How long have you been doing that? A: 30 years.</p>
<p>Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm? A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm. Court: This witness is an expert in the area of the bullet matching algorithm. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts.</p>
<p>Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm? A: 17 times.</p>
<p>Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets? A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.</p>
<p>The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis.</p>
Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

<p>In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.</p>
<p>Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.</p>
<p>The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber’s face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.</p>
<p>As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.</p>
<p>Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.</p>
<p>Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant’s vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.</p>
<p>terry smith: Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department? A: I received my bachelor’s degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I’ve toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I’ve attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners. A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases. Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm? A: They have been using it since January of 2020.</p>
<p>Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm? A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.</p>
<p>Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing? A: Yes, I have. A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.</p>
<p>Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination. Court: Any cross on their credentials? Defense: No, Your Honor. Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead. A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They’re cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet. A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I’ve seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail.

<p>Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm? A: 17 times.</p>
<p>Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets? A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.</p>
<p>The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis.</p>
<p>Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature. A: The signature for the two bullets being compared are aligned such that the best fit between the two signatures is achieved. The striation marks between the two signatures are then compared by evaluating how many of the high points and low points correspond. The algorithm can calculate the number of consecutively matching striations (CMS), or consecutively matching high points and low points - these are features used directly by some examiners to characterize the strength of a match. It also calculates the cross correlation between the two signatures, which is a numerical measure of the similarity between the two lands ranging between -1 and 1.</p>
<p>These traits are combined using what is known as a random forest. Each forest is composed of decision trees, which use a subset of the observed values in order to make a decision about whether or not the bullets constitute a match. The other observations are held out in order to determine an error rate. When the random forest makes a prediction, each decision tree “ votes ” , producing a numerical value between 0 and 1 corresponding to the proportion of trees which evaluate the features as being sufficiently similar to have come from the same source.</p>
Q: Have you tested this algorithm? A: Yes. This algorithm was tested and validated on a number of different test sets of bullet scans. It was found that, as long as there are sufficient marks on the bullet, the algorithm could successfully distinguish between bullets fired by the same gun and those fired from different guns. Examiners’ visual comparisons are also limited by the presence or absence of individualizing marks. Two test sets were using consecutively rifled barrels, which should be the most difficult to assess, and it was shown that the algorithm could distinguish between the bullets fired from two separate guns with complete accuracy.

<p>Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say? A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.</p>
<p>—Questions Submitted By the Jury—</p>
<p>The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you’re able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure? A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it’s about 1.5 to 1.9. That’s just a general number that’s out there.</p>
<p>DR ADRIAN JONES</p>
<p>Q: What is your current occupation? A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.</p>
<p>Q: How long have you been doing that? A: 30 years.</p>
<p>Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm? A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm. Court: This witness is an expert in the area of the bullet matching algorithm. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts.</p>
<p>Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm? A: 17 times.</p>
<p>Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets? A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.</p>
<p>The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis.</p>
<p>Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature. A: The signature for the two bullets being compared are aligned such that the best fit between the two signatures is achieved. The striation marks between the two signatures are then compared by evaluating how many of the high points and low points correspond. The algorithm can calculate the number of consecutively matching striations (CMS), or consecutively matching high points and low points - these are features used directly by some examiners to characterize the strength of a match. It also calculates the cross correlation between the two signatures, which is a numerical measure of the similarity between the two lands ranging between -1 and 1.</p>
<p>These traits are combined using what is known as a random forest. Each forest is composed of decision trees, which use a subset of the observed values in order to make a decision about whether or not the bullets constitute a match. The other observations are held out in order to determine an error rate. When the random forest makes a prediction, each decision tree “ votes ” , producing a numerical value between 0 and 1 corresponding to the proportion of trees which evaluate the features as being sufficiently similar to have come from the same source.</p>
Q: Have you tested this algorithm? A: Yes. This algorithm was tested and validated on a number of different test sets of bullet scans. It was found that, as long as there are sufficient marks on the bullet, the algorithm could successfully distinguish between bullets fired by the same gun and those fired from different guns. Examiners’ visual comparisons are also limited by the presence or absence of individualizing marks. Two test sets were using consecutively rifled barrels, which should be the most difficult to assess, and it was shown that the algorithm could distinguish between the bullets fired from two separate guns with complete accuracy.
